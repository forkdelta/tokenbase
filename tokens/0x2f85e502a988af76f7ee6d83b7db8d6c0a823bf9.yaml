  Latium is a tasking platform working to connect employers and employees in a fully transparent and trustless
  process.

  The LatiumX (LATX) ERC20 token will be the established form of payment on the platform. Payment for tasks
  completed on the Latium platform will be credited in real-time using LATX, meaning the LATX tokens will have
  to be purchased by employers in order to create new tasks in the system.
