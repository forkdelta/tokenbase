  Pycoin is a privacy preserving zero-knowledge protocol-based decentralized platform for writing, testing and
  deploying mathematically verifiable cyber contracts in Python language that behave exactly as intended.Unlike
  Ethereum smart contracts with a history of repeated hacks and stolen funds, hundreds and millions of dollars, Pycoin
  ensures that no run time errors or intentional/unintentional bugs can be used as exploits to steal funds and corrupt
  Pycoin cyber contracts. Pycoin can be also used as a platform for launching a number of next generation
  decentralized applications such as scalable decentralized exchanges(DEXs), automated hedge funds and darkpools.
