Having already implemented Industry 4.0 technology, robotics and integrated digitalisation, Dentaprime offers the highest quality dentistry affordable to all people, regardless of their income.\nThe Dentacoin ERC20 token is configured to be used globally by all individuals.\nDentacoin Fundation, the DCN inventor, bought 100% of Dentaprime International PLCs&rsquo; shares thus the disposition over the company will be in the hands of Dentacoin Foundation and will be connected to the blockchain.\nEach DCN represents and participates in the company&rsquo;s shares and dividends. The DCN community will vote for important decisions of the company through an integrated voting system.\nFurther projects are planned:\nThe health data base: In addition to the currency (DCN), the Ethereum blockchain will securely handle all private patient data. Further data will be updatable and accessible to patients.\nThe Insurance: Following treatment, Dentaprime will offer each patient a DCN paid insurance policy for lifelong free dental procedures to prevent all the health consequences related to old-age poverty.\nDentacoin will develop as both, a stable growing international currency and an attractive alternate derivate system for investors.","links":[{"Bitcointalk":"https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1944236.0"},{"Blog":"https://www.dentacoin.com/blog/"},{"CoinMarketCap":"dentacoin"},{"Email":"mailto:admin@dentacoin.com"},{"Facebook":"https://www.facebook.com/dentacoin/"},{"Github":"https://github.com/Dentacoin"},{"Reddit":"https://www.reddit.com/r/Dentacoin/"},{"Slack":"https://dentacoin.slack.com/"},{"Twitter":"https://twitter.com/dentacoin"},{"Website":"https://dentacoin.com/"},{"Whitepaper":"https://www.dentacoin.com/white-paper/Whitepaper-en%20v.1.0.pdf"}],"name":"Dentacoin","symbol":"\u0668"},"0x08f5a9235b08173b7569f83645d2c7fb55e8ccd8":{"addr":"0x08f5a9235b08173b7569f83645d2c7fb55e8ccd8","decimals":8,"description":"Tierion is using the blockchain to transform how the world secures and shares data.","links":[{"Bitcointalk":"https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=2027510.0"},{"Blog":"https://medium.com/@WayneVaughan"},{"CoinMarketCap":"tierion"},{"Email":"mailto:tokensale@tierion.com"},{"Facebook":"https://www.facebook.com/TierionInc/"},{"Github":"https://github.com/Tierion"},{"Reddit":"https://www.reddit.com/r/tierion/"},{"Telegram":"https://t.me/tierion"},{"Twitter":"https://twitter.com/Tierion"},{"Website":"https://tokensale.tierion.com/"},{"Website":"https://tierion.com/"},{"Whitepaper":"https://tokensale.tierion.com/whitepaper"}],"name":"Tierion Network Token","symbol":"TNT"},"0x08f8117155aa9414b67113a47ad269d47974e9dc":{"addr":"0x08f8117155aa9414b67113a47ad269d47974e9dc","decimals":18,"description":"On traditional server architectures, every aplication need to set up its own servers that run their own code in isolated silos, making sharing of data hard.

This ensures that the data is securely stored in a decentralized manner that exhibits great redundancy and failure resistance. The Oyster Pearl(PRL) is an ERC20 token that exhibits unique qualities that are built upon the smart contract framework of Ethereum.

Throughout the house there will be up to 100 cameras streaming life inside live, in High Definition, 24 hours per day. Cameras will be placed in all living areas, party and bar areas, swimming pool, gym and spa areas, the outdoor kitchen and hot tub area and in the bedrooms and bathrooms all of which broadcast live pictures and audio to our paying customers.

Viewers can chat in an open chat room and tip the model at anytime or they can engage in a private show with the model. It is the profit derived from these Live Show rooms that will be distributed quarterly to ROC token holders. Members can vote on what type of weekly party will take place in the house, they can choose for their favourite model to take yoga classes, painting or piano lessons, they can buy roses, perfume and other gifts or they can send their favourite model a bottle of wine and a box of chocolates allowing our members to interact with our models in many different ways.

It is called \"proof-of-PLAY&rdquo; and rewards every player, that plays the game GO on the public fa&ccedil;ade of the museum of modern arts in Graz Austria during the one month mining period, with virtual tokens (coins) for playing the game, no matter if they won or lost. For every valid move the players gets one token. Thus, this project puts the human at the centre of value creation, not machines. For every token mined, a supplement coin is generated to sell. These tokens are sold before and after the mining phase through an auction. 100% of the money raised is donated to non-profit-privacy organisations who do good work in the area of protection of privacy.","links":[{"Website":"https://play.lab10.coop"}],"name":"PLAY","symbol":"PLY"},"0xfb4752ad1b7153e1dbd2e6662651a11c7fc14083":{"__FORKDELTA_CUSTOM_SYMBOL":"MPESA","addr":"0xfb4752ad1b7153e1dbd2e6662651a11c7fc14083","decimals":8,"description":"ERC20 token based on ETHEREUM NETWORK","links":[{"Website":"http://www.mpesa.world/"}],"name":"MPESA","symbol":"mPESA"},"0xfb7da9863e030495db8b4d067d665fc8433fff85":{"addr":"0xfb7da9863e030495db8b4d067d665fc8433fff85","decimals":18,"description":"PCC PCORN is an adult entertainment platform build with the best software technologies and practices.
