  WISH is an Ethereum tokens - access tokens issued by WishFinance platform
  and needed to build and manage a loan portfolio on the platform.
  The more prominent platform will become, the more loans it will process the
  more WISH tokens will be in use. Lenders could use only tokens deposited on
  the platform. And they could be traded from a public token holders on the
  exchanges, just as other access and utility tokens.
