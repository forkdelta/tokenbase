  ælf is a decentralized self-evolving cloud computing network. To establish
  a Blockchain infrastructure for various commercial requirements, ælf provides
  a highly efficient multi-chain parallel-processing system with cross-chain
  communication and self-evolving governance. It brings three innovations
  namely scalable nodes on cluster of computers, resource isolation for smart
  contracts via “one chain to one smart contract” and voting through token
  holders.

  ELF tokens are used to pay resource fees in the system, such as deployment
  of smart contracts, operating and upgrading of systems (transaction fees,
  cross-chain data transfer fees). It also enables community to vote on major
  decisions, such as electing mining nodes, introducing new features to the
  system and other major decisions.
