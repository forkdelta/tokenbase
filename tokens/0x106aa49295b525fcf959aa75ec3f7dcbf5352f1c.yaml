  The Gibraltar Blockchain Exchange (GBX) aims to be a world-leading institutional-grade token sale platform
  and cryptocurrency exchange coupled with a comprehensive listing process, AML/KYC best practices and
  public consensus within a governed environment.

  The Rock Token (RKT) is an ERC-20 compliant utility token for use within the GBX/GSX ecosystem. Its
  primary use will be as a preferred medium of exchange. It will also be used to pay for fees within
  the full-service ecosystem, used for sponsor/issuer staking, and early access and possible discounts
  for future token sales on the platform.

  Please refer to part G of the Whitepaper for more detailed description.
