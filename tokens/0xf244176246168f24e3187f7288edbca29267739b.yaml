  Havven is decentralised payment network designed to enable everyday
  cryptocurrency purchases. The network utilises a dual token system to reduce
  price volatility. The fees from transactions within the system are used to
  collateralise the network. The collateral is secured by the blockchain enabling
  the creation of a new asset-backed stablecoin, nomin tokens. Each transaction
  will generate fees that are paid to havven token holders. As transaction volume
  grows, the value of the platform increases and active participants are rewarded
  with increased transaction fees.
