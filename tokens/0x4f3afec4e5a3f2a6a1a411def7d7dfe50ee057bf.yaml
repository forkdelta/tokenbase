  Gold Backed Tokens

  Each token represents 1gm of 99.99% LBMA standard gold and secured in safehouse vaults.

  Its value should track the value of Gold, since it can be purchased at the price of Gold and redeemed for physical gold at the Digix Marketplace https://digix.global/app/

  Not to be confused with DigixDAO (DGD) governance tokens, that entitle the holder to transaction fees incurred on the DGX tokens.
