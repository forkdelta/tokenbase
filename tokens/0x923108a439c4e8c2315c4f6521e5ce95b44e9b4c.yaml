  The Devery platform allows suppliers and consumers to prove the authenticity
  of their products online before purchase, essentially removing the need for
  ‘trust’ in e-commerce. It aims to protect brands and consumers from counterfeiting
  using blockchain powered product verification by providing unique, verifiable
  identifiers to each product throughout the supply chain.

  EVE token is the native token of the Devery platform. It is used to power the Devery
  verification platform.
