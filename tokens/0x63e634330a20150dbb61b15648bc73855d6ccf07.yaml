  Blocklancer is a Distributed Autonomous Job Marketplace (DAJ) operating on the Ethereum Blockchain. Blocklancer
  is our collaborative vision of an entirely self-regulatory platform for finding clients/projects and ensuring
  jobs are completed efficiently and fairly. Blocklancer is changing the way freelancing works for both the
  freelancer and the customer, concentrating on building a trustworthy platform all stakeholders can rely on.
  Blocklancer does this by minimalizing fees and introducing a decentralized tribunal system to guarantee every
  dispute case is settled fairly and that no one loses out â€” we can finally wave goodbye to fraud in freelancing.
