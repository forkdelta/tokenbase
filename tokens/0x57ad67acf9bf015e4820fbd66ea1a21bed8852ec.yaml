  Lympo is building an app, a fitness wallet, which will help people to reach their healthy lifestyle
  goals and earn tokens in return. Lympo users will be able to share and monetise their fitness and
  wellness data which we all track on our phones and wearables.

  Lympo token LYM will be used as a utility token in order to pay for fitness, wellness and other
  health enhancing products and services, earn token rewards for fitness data, register permissions to
  share this personal data, interact with health insurances and employers who want to encourage their
  staff to remain healthy and developers who submit new applications to further use fitness data.
