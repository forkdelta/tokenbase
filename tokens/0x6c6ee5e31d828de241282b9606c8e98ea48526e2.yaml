  Holo is a decentralized hosting platform that enables fully-functional
  decentralized applications to serve mainstream Internet users, and provides the
  massively scalable crypto-accounting infrastructure required to host and manage
  these applications at such enormous volumes of usage.

  HoloTokens (HOT) are temporary ERC20 tokens purchased with ETH which will become
  exchangeable for Holo fuel when the Holo ecosystem launches later in 2018.
