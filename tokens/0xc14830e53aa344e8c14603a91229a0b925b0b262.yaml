  The PXT Token is going to be used for that exact value exchange. Monetzing data.

  The Populous ecosystem will be able to provide existing financial systems incredible
  value on the transfer of data and micro-services that we see companies paying a
  huge premium for at the moment.

  Companies will have to use said PXT Token in order for them to take advantage
  of things such as Credit reports and Analysis, or to fully utilise our API.
