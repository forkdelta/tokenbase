  Potentiam is a music social networking platform governed by the users where the
  rewards are distributed between all those that bring value to it without the
  need for middlemen. This is possible with the use of smart contracts
  (pre-defined contracts) via blockchain technology, an incorruptible, transparent
  digital ledger that can be programmed to record virtually everything of value.
  It's more secure than all systems present today. The rewards are distributed
  with the use of cryptocurrency PTM.

  Potentiam PTM tokens are the platformâ€™s backbone and will serve as the medium of
  exchange for all platform transactions.
