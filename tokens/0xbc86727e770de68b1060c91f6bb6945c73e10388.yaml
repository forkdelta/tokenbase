  Ink Protocol is a decentralized payment and reputation system based on Ethereum. It is
  designed specifically for P2P marketplace transactions where trust mechanisms
  between the buyer and seller are limited or non-existent. The protocol will first be
  deployed on an existing marketplace called Listia and can be integrated independently into any
  existing external marketplace via the Ink Pay App.

  The underlying token of Ink Protocol, XNK, is built on the Ethereum blockchain and is ERC20
  compatible. The function of the XNK token is carrying out transactions on the Ink Protocol
  platform.
