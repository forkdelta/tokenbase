  EOS open source is a powerful infrastructure for Blockchain Applications.
  However the Governance Structure and Ownership model leads to highly
  manipulated compensation and lacks trusted partners for the community to build
  on. Evolution is a community driven adaptation of EOS open source software.
  Evolution structures votes and evenly distributes tokens to ensure true
  decentralization.
