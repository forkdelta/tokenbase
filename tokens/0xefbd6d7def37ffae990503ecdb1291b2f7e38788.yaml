  EOS open source is a powerful infrastructure for Blockchain Applications. However the
  Governance Structure and Ownership model leads to highly manipulated
  compensation and lacks trusted partners for the community to build on. Evolution is a community driven adaptation of EOS open source software.
  Evolution structures votes and evenly distributes tokens to ensure true decentralization.
