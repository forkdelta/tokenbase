  Swarm Fund is the blockchain for private equity. Itâ€™s a fully decentralized capital market place
  that democratizes investing by using the power of the blockchain to open up high-return, alternative
  investment classes to smaller investors through asset-backed funds using cryptocurrency tokens. It
  makes traditionally exclusive investment opportunities, such as private equity and hedge funds,
  inclusive for the Swarm by pooling together smaller investments into larger, institutional-sized
  blocks.
