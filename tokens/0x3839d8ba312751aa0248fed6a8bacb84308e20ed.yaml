  Bezop is a decentralized peer to peer e-commerce order management and processing system powered
  by smart contracts, an autonomous buyer-seller protection service and a simple vat collection
  system all built on a decentralized blockchain network. Bezop aims to provide an open source and
  complete solution for running a successful ecommerce business online. Merchants can participate
  by selling products and services on their self-hosted e-commerce stores (the Bezop DOM) and
  broadcast orders to the network. Bezop implements a novel Proof of order which lowers the rate
  of fraud for both a merchant and client using elegantly designed contracts powered by the
  ethereum blockchain and secured cryptographically. Merchants can collect VAT and accurately
  manage orders.
