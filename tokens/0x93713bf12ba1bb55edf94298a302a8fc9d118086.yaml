  Asterion Space is an open-source initiative to build a virtual reality world. It uses blockchain
  technology to claim and transfer virtual land, keeping a permanent record of ownership and will
  enable to create virtual communities in the near future. A public Virtual Reality world should be
  ruled by open standards, shielded from the agenda of any central organization.
